=======================

This readme file is the one that is shown in GitHub. It is formatted using
the markdown system. Modify it to your will.

The template is structured around the `macros` file, which loads all my
favorite packages and does some basic setup. The `titlepage` file is in
charge of creating the cover of the document. There are several variables that
need to be defined at the top of the document for it to work.
